The files in this directory show how to write new macros in Java or how to add new predefined formulas.
The commands \newcommand and \newenvironment are already handled by JLaTeXMath but I didn't implemented any TeX functions. So low-level macros can be added to JLaTeXMath but they must be wrote in Java (or in any language callable by Java).
